# My Fedora Gnome Install

This script is to automate as much as possible the post installation of my Fedora Gnome system or provide instructions for personalization. It is still a work in progress and as things can be automated they will be moved from this README to the fedoraGnomeSetup.sh script. Obviously you take this repository and modify it to your taste.

1. Clone this repository to your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:sgt7io/fedora-gnome-sgt7.git
cd fedora-gnome-sgt7
```

2. Run the fedoraGnomeSetup.sh script

```bash
$ chmod 700 fedoraGnomeSetup.sh
$ ./fedoraGnomeSetup.sh
```

Install Desktop Desktop Icons,and User Themes Extensions

There are numerous themes and icons on the internet, but I simply use the
easy to install Numix GTK theme and Numix circle icons.

I also use the following wallpaper, which I sourced from [catppuccin-wallpapers](https://github.com/zhichaoh/catppuccin-wallpapers "Fedora Black 4k Wallpaper"):
